In the above project, we will be working with various data analysis tools, including SQL, Power BI, and Excel, to derive insights from the dataset. SQL will help us manipulate the data and perform some feature engineering. Excel and Power BI will assist us in visualizing our findings in a way that is easy for stakeholders to consume.
